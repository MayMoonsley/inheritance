Reconfigurable Architecture
February 197{I}

I've designed a marvelous way to improve the efficacy of the tower. By rigging each room with a combination of electric motors, hydraulics, and digital control circuitry, I could make it so that the entire floor plan can be rearranged on command. Why walk up and down so many stairs when I could summon any one of the tower's workshops, laboratories, or storerooms and have it move into place?

In the short term, I estimate that renovating the tower to be self-reconfiguring will provide a {16}-percent increase in my productivity. In the long term, in the event that my experiments in life extension and rejuvenation take more than a few decades to bear fruit, not having to walk up and down the stairs of the tower will help me stay productive as I grow older.
