Character:The Clone
Project S2 Experiment Log
October 29, 195{T} - My previous experiments with cloning have been less than successful. However, new studies I have undertaken indicate that this attempt may be successful. I still have no ethical samples, so I must use myself as a test subject once more.
October 30, 195{T} - Preliminary results are promising. This clone will require time to grow, and I regret that tomorrow's festivities will prevent me from taking detailed notes on his progress.
November 1, 195{T} - The clone's progress remains promising.
December 14, 195{T} - Success! He is finally grown enough to be removed from the cloning apparatus. I must confess to a swell of pride upon seeing him - he even resembles the photographs Mother showed me of myself when I was young. I will instruct him in the matters of science at once.
