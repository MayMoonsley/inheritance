A Letter In The Mail
September 29, 198{E}
Dear Ms. {Loremipsum},
    I regret to inform you that your grandfather, Dr. {Loremipsum}, has passed away. As I am sure you are already aware, he named you his sole beneficiary.
    While it is not a condition of you receiving your inheritance, he requested that you visit his tower at some point in the coming months.
    You have my deepest condolences and sympathies in what I am sure is an incredibly trying time. If you require assistance arranging funerary matters, I would be honored to provde it.
    Yours,
    Mr. {Dolorsit}
    Executor of Dr. {Loremipsum}'s Estate
