Tutorial
You have three main resources: Health, Energy, and Scrip.
Health is reduced when you get attacked, and you lose if it hits zero.
Most tools require Energy. It gets replenished each turn.
Scrip is the currency of this world. It can be spent at shops.
Use arrow keys or click adjacent rooms to move around the map.
You will encounter many foes in your journey. Moving to the same space as them will start a fight. Use your tools in battle to defeat them.
In battles you might get Statuses. Mouse over them to see what they do.
Bottles on the map contain Traits. Unlike Statuses, these stick with you. Some traits are bad... use your best judgement!
Strange machines contain Modifiers that you can use to improve your equipment. Be careful - some of them have tradeoffs!
Staircases on the map take you to the next floor.
Get to the last floor and defeat the boss to win.
Good luck!
