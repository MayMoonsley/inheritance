# How to create unlockable lore notes

    Each lore note is created from a .txt file. In normal notes, the first line of the file is the note's title and the remaining lines are its body.

    Character notes, which are unlocked by playing as a particular character, start with "Character:<Character Name>" as the first line, e.g. "Character:The Clone". Their second line is the title and the remaining lines are the body.



    These files are converted into the NoteResources.ts file during pre-processing
